Strassen’s method, for matrix multiply
----
The key to Strassen’s method is to make the recursion tree slightly less bushy. That is, instead of performing eight recursive multiplications of $n/2 \times n/2$ matrices, it performs only seven. page.79 

The birthday paradox, for expectation
----
By random variables, for each pair (i,j) of the k people in the room, we define the indicator random variable Xij. When person-pair (i,j) have the same birthday, Xij = 1, otherwise 0. ... by calculate the expectation, with at least 28 people, we expect to find at least one matching pair of birthdays. 

decision tree, for insert-sort operating, for lower bound estimation
----
The decision tree for insertion sort operating on three elements. An internal node an notated by i:j indicates a comparison between ai and aj. A leaf annotated by the permutation pi(1) ... pi(n) indicates the ordering A_pi(1) <=... <= A_pi(n). page 192
