Strassen’s method, for matrix multiply
----
The key to Strassen’s method is to make the recursion tree slightly less bushy. That is, instead of performing eight recursive multiplications of $n/2 \times n/2$ matrices, it performs only seven. page.79 

The birthday paradox, for expectation
----
By random variables, for each pair (i,j) of the k people in the room, we define the indicator random variable Xij. When person-pair (i,j) have the same birthday, Xij = 1, otherwise 0. ... by calculate the expectation, with at least 28 people, we expect to find at least one matching pair of birthdays. 

decision tree, for insert-sort operating, for lower bound estimation
----
The decision tree (a full binary tree) for insertion sort operating on three elements. An internal node an notated by i:j indicates a comparison between ai and aj. A leaf annotated by the permutation pi(1) ... pi(n) indicates the ordering A_pi(1) <=... <= A_pi(n). page 192

radix sort
----
Radix sort is the algorithm used by the card-sorting machines you now find only in computer museums. Figure 8.3 shows the operation of radix sort on a list of seven 3-digit numbers. The leftmost column is the input. The remaining columns show the list after successive sorts on increasingly significant digit positions. Shading indicates the digit position sorted on to produce each list from the previous one. page 198.
